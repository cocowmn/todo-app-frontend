# todo-app-frontend
Frontend website for Habibi Code/ACM full stack workshop to work with the To-Do backend

## Objectives

In the interest of developing an MVP for our backend, we want to support a subset of the core functionality required for a working to-do application.
For this workshop, this includes:

* Render all of the existing To-Do Lists to the screen when the page loads
* Allow new lists to be added
  * Update the display when a new list is added
* Allow new items to be added to existing lists
  * Update the display when a new item is added to an existing list
* Allow users to mark an item as "complete"

## Extended Objectives

For future iterations and additional exploration, we would also like to:

* Add CSS Styling to make the page more visually appealing
* Add support for the additional backend operations, like Delete List and Update Item
* Add persistence to item "complete" status, which is not a field that is stored in the database
